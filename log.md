# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 31, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked through HTML & HTML5 basics course on freecodecamp.com

**Thoughts**: It as enjoyable and pretty well paced. Everything made sense in the course with 28 segments. Finished it. I made decent progress and it was cool to see things work together.

### Day 1: August 1, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked through basic CSS course on freecodecamp.com

**Thoughts** Easy enough, seemed pretty simplistic and repetitive, could'vve been faster paced. Completed all 44 segments of the course today. Enjoyed seeing the animation on the cute penguin at the end of the course.

### Day 2: August 2, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked though Applied Visual Design on freecodecamp.com

**Thoughts** Almost didn't do it today. Felt sleepy and just not up for it but did it anyway. I didn't complete the course got 35 out 52 segments completed. Seemed repetitive again but I enjoyed being able to do some cool things with gradients and shadows.

### Day 3: August 4, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked through Applied Visual Design on freecodecamp.com

**Thoughts** Although feeling sleepy got done with the Visual Design, all 52 segments complete. Found it cool that you code use css code to animate things on a webpage. Bezier curve was trippy to figure out though. I find it helpful that freecodecamp corrects you when you forget a semi-colon, was guilty of that twice today...
